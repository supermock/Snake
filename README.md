# Snake Game

Nothing more, nothing less than the classic game of the snake. Made in Java when I was starting in this world of technology. It was very interesting to do something like this when I was just starting out, since I always challenge myself to new things, whether you are starting or are already challenged too!

##### How to run?
You can download the file '.jar' on the flap **Releases** or make a `git clone` of the project in your workspace.

##### Controls (Keyboard) 
- **P** (Pause)
- **Directional arrows** (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

##### How the game is?
The bigger the snake, the greater the difficulty is, because the speed of the snake is increasing giving a greater challenge to the player.
